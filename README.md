# Auto-MPG-Prediction-RidgeCV-Inferential-Statistics

## Data
Auto- MPG data-set from UCI Machine Learning Library. The data-set is fairly standard on kaggle but can be accessed separately from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### what is the auto-mpg data set?

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

The following description can be found on the UCI Repository page for the data-set (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG)
